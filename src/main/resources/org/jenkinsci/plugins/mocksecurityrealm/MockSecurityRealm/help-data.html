<div>
    <p>
        List of users, separated by newlines.
        Each line should have a username, optionally followed by group names (separated by spaces).
        Password is optional. If not set it is the same as the username.
        To set a different password use the username/password format. Passwords cannot have spaces in them.

        For example:
        <br/><b>Format : username/password group1 ... groupN</b>
    </p>
    <pre>alice
bob/marley admins
charlie/rocks! qa
darlene qa admins</pre>
</div>
