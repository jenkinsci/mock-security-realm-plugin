<div>
    <p>
        List of users, separated by newlines.
        Each line should have a username, optionally followed by group names (separated by spaces).
        The password is always the same as the username.
        To set a different password use the username/password format. Passwords cannot have spaces in them.

        Format : username/password group(s)
        For example:
    </p>
    <pre>alice
bob/marley admins
charlie/rocks! qa
darlene qa admins</pre>
</div>
